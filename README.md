INTEGRATED PROGRAMMING LAB-LAB PROJECT

Project description :
In this project, there is two main modules admin module and customer module.
The customer can register himself/herself in the platform by using the
registration form. After successful registration the customer can sign in to the
website to reserve the car.
The customer password is hashed and stored in database. The hashing technique
used is SHA- 1 hashing algorithm.
After successful sign-in by the customer, the customer can see the list of cars
available.
From that list of cars available the customer can choose the car he wants and he
wants to fill the pickup and destination locations and he also wants to fill the
pickup and drop off dates of the car and he wants to give his license number and
after this he is redirected to the page to send his reservation id to his mail by
clicking a button.
Now the car is successfully reserved and the customer can go to the admin place
to pick the reserved car.
The customer tells the admin the reservation id and admin validates it and
collects his credit card details and give the car he reserved.
After the customer returns the car, the admin enters the reservation id and carid
in a form and the website updates the info that the car is returned and the credit
car details of the customer is removed and the returned car is now available to
others.
The final receipt is sent to the customer email after he returned the car.

customer returned the car and also total rent and other details that we have.
